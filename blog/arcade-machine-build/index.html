    <p>Back in 2013 I won a starter kit for makers from the Make Magazine. It had a Raspberry Pi Model 1 and some basic components. <strong>I spent several months looking for something interesting to build, but nothing caught my attention.</strong> I remember I almost gave up when I found <a href="https://retropie.org.uk/">RetroPie</a>. <strong>RetroPie allows you to turn your Raspberry Pi into a retro-gaming machine.</strong></p>

    <!-- <img loading="lazy" alt="Raspberry Pi kit" src="/blog/arcade-machine-build/01-raspberry-pi-kit.jpg"> -->
    <!-- <h2 id="retropie">RetroPie</h2> -->

    <p>I ran a quick experiment installing some ROMs to check how it worked. I was surprised <strong>how straightforward it was to have a working retro console with almost zero configuration</strong>. Though, it took me a while to set it up properly to make the most of it. I wrote a <a href="/blog/setting-up-retropie">complete guide</a> with the entire process step by step.</p>

    <!-- <img loading="lazy" alt="Super Mario Bros. 3 running on RetroPie" src="/blog/arcade-machine-build/02-super-mario-bros-raspi.jpg"> -->

    <h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

    <p>After successfully running RetroPie, I realized I could fit the Raspberry Pi with its tiny footprint inside an arcade cabinet. I looked everywhere for cabinets to restore, only to find <strong>costly wooden boxes in terrible conditions. Most of them were not worthwhile for restore, heavy, difficult to move, too big for an apartment, and expensive.</strong></p>

    <p>The only way to get the results I wanted would be by <strong>building an arcade cabinet from scratch</strong>. In those terms, I was looking for something that was:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Easy to build and move around.</li>
      <li>Affordable.</li>
      <li>Suitable for an apartment.</li>
      <li>Old-school/Nostalgic shape.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="the-plans">The plans</h2>
    
    <p>Right after setting my expectations for an ideal arcade machine, I looked for some information on building one and quickly found <a href="https://estherkoenig.dk/mame/eng/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project MAME</a>. <strong>The project has open-source plans to build different types of arcade cabinets from scratch.</strong> The one with the shape I was looking for was able to hold a PC with a keyboard and all. That added complexity to the build for something I didn't want to. The good part was that <strong>it was able to fit a flat screen inside</strong>.</p>

    <p>One of the many adaptations of that cabinet was this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220701142857/https://zonaarcade.forumcommunity.net/?t=48865036" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paper Mario themed arcade (in Spanish)</a>. The author <a href="https://img543.imageshack.us/img543/5624/repordiviciacosplanos.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improved the original plans</a> to <strong>use only MAME controllers and to have a taller marquee</strong>. <strong>He also made available the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220701142854/https://zonaarcade.forumcommunity.net/?t=45015457" target="_blank" rel="noopener">side art</a> and a SketchUp 3D model:</strong></p>
    
    <img loading="lazy" alt="A 3D model of the arcade cabinet" src="/blog/arcade-machine-build/05-3D-model.jpg"/>
    
    <p>I only modified the width of the original plans by 2 cm. so the cabinet could fit an old 26" monitor that I've already had. I followed the rest of the plans as specified:</p>

    <img src="/blog/arcade-machine-build/arcade-cabinet-plans.jpg" alt="A notebook with the hand drawn plans"/>

    <!-- <h2 id="a-model-in-cardboard">A model in cardboard</h2> -->

    <p>Before even buying materials, <strong>I built a 1/10th model in cardboard to see everything together</strong>. That way, I was sure that all made sense and was able to check if anything needed to be adjusted or redefined, especially after the width modification that I had to do. The model was 17 cm. height and <strong>it helped in defining the size and distribution of the speaker grills</strong>.</p>

    <!-- <img loading="lazy" alt="Model in cardboard" src="/blog/arcade-machine-build/06-cardboard.jpg"> -->

    <h2 id="materials">Materials</h2>

    <p>The most important decision was to choose what type of wood I'd use. <strong>I was between MDF, plywood, and particleboard</strong>. I chose MDF, but if I had known how hard it was to clean up the thin dust when sanding it, <strong>I'd have chosen another one</strong>. On the other hand, it was a very versatile material: <strong>easy to cut and drill</strong>.</p>

    <!-- <img loading="lazy" alt="MDF boards" src="/blog/arcade-machine-build/07-MDF-boards.jpg"> -->

    <p>The materials I used trough the entire project were:</p>
    
    <h4 id="mdf-boards-15mm-">MDF boards (15mm thickness):</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>(2x) 169x60cm: Both laterals</li>
      <li>(2x) 16x62cm: Marquee bottom panel and speakers panel</li>
      <li>(2x) 25x62cm: Monitor support and controllers top panel</li>
      <li>(1x) 28x62cm: Marquee top panel</li>
      <li>(1x) 12x62cm: Controllers front panel</li>
      <li>(1x) 75x62cm: Front panel</li>
      <li>(1x) 60x62cm: Back panel</li>
      <li>(1x) 45x62cm: Bottom cover</li>
      <li>(1x) 94x62cm: Back door. I went for 5 mm thickness on this one</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 id="crystal-clear-acrylic-sheets-">Acrylic sheets:</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>(1x) 55x62cm x 2.4mm thick: Monitor cover</li>
      <li>(1x) 25x62cm x 2.4mm thick: Controllers art cover</li>
      <li>(2x) 13x62cm x 4mm thick: Marquee back and front</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 id="others-">Other materials:</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>4 cm x 2 cm pine strips</li>
      <li>80- and 360-grit sandpaper</li>
      <li>3.5 mm x 30 mm golden screws for the strips</li>
      <li>3.5 mm x 40 mm black screws for the MDF boards</li>
      <li>Wood putty</li>
      <li>White primer for MDF</li>
      <li>Glossy white spray paint</li>
      <li>Matte black spray paint</li>
      <li>2 small speaker grills: 9 cm black mesh (12 cm including frame)</li>
      <li>2 big speaker grills: 15 cm black mesh (18 cm including frame)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="first-cuts">First cuts</h2>

    <p>After getting all the MDF boards, <strong>I drew the shape of the cabinet in both laterals based on the plans</strong>. I've also used a pair of compasses to draw the curves.</p>

    <img loading="lazy" alt="Drawings with measurements on the lateral board" src="/blog/arcade-machine-build/08-MDF-drawings.jpg"/>
    
    <p>I sticked both laterals together with paper tape to make only one cut. <strong>This was actually a mistake, since the thicker the surface to cut, the more the blade will bow.</strong> I fixed it later just sanding the edges.</p>

    <!-- <figure>
      <img loading="lazy" alt="Jigsaw" src="/blog/arcade-machine-build/67-jigsaw.jpg"> -->
    <!-- </figure> -->
    <img loading="lazy" alt="The lateral boards after making cuts" src="/blog/arcade-machine-build/09-first-cut.jpg"/>

    <p>After making all the cuts, I learned a couple of valuable lessons:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li><strong>MDF produces fine dust when sanded:</strong> It doesn't matter how much gloves, masks, safety glasses I wore, <strong>I had to deal with dust in my hair and clothes for days</strong>. It was a nightmare to clean up after cutting or sanding. I even broke a vacuum cleaner trying to clean everything up.</li>

      <li><strong>While cutting thick wood, the blade may flex or bow:</strong> In my case, it would have been better <strong>not to cut both boards together</strong>.</li>

      <li><strong>The jigsaw blade gets hot and burns the wood</strong> unless you let the jigsaw cool down from time to time. My mistake was to make lengthy cuts in one single run: <img loading="lazy" alt="Some curved cuts that appear to be burned" src="/blog/arcade-machine-build/10-burned-wood.jpg"/></li>
    </ol>

    <!-- <h2 id="sandpaper">Sandpaper</h2> -->
    
    <!-- <img loading="lazy" alt="White sandpaper" src="/blog/arcade-machine-build/11-sandpapers.jpg"> -->

    <p>I used 80- and 360-grit sandpaper to smooth the edges and surfaces. <strong>While the former is a coarse grit for smoothing surfaces and removing imperfections, the latter is a fine grit for finishing surfaces smoothly.</strong> Sanding was also good for covering all the mistakes I made during the cuts.</p>
    
    <img loading="lazy" alt="Both lateral boards, back to back, sanded" src="/blog/arcade-machine-build/12-sanded-boards.jpg"/>
    <img loading="lazy" alt="Close up of one of the lateral boards, sanded" src="/blog/arcade-machine-build/13-sanded-board-detail.jpg"/>

    <!-- <p>I later used the 360-grit sandpaper to smooth the surfaces between each paint coat.</p> -->

    <h2 id="strips">Strips</h2>

    <p><strong>I decided to join all the pieces using strips.</strong> That way, I not only achieved millimetric precision in positioning the MDF boards but also managed to do so alone, without any help. I cut a bunch of 4 cm x 2 cm pine strips to the size of the boards they will be joining.</p>

    <img loading="lazy" alt="Multiple pine strips on a table" src="/blog/arcade-machine-build/14-battens.jpg"/>

    <p>It wasn't necessary to use glue when I was already using screws, but I decided to use it anyway to hold the entire structure tight. I've also used a bigger drill bit on the surface to make the screws go deeper.</p>

    <img loading="lazy" alt="Pine strips being held to one of the lateral boards using paper tape" src="/blog/arcade-machine-build/15-battens-detail.jpg"/>

    <p>I attached all the strips to both lateral boards using 3.5 mm x 30 mm screws and carpenter's wood glue.</p>

    <img loading="lazy" alt="Pine strips attached to the lateral boards" src="/blog/arcade-machine-build/19-attached-battens-laterals.jpg"/>

    <img loading="lazy" alt="Pine strips attached to the bottom board" src="/blog/arcade-machine-build/18-attached-battens-bottom.jpg"/>

    <h2 id="first-assembly">First assembly</h2>

    <p>I assembled all the pieces to see the final shape and size. At first, <strong>it looked like a massive fridge inside my apartment, but it began to take shape and improved as the project progressed</strong>.</p>

    <img loading="lazy" alt="A half-way done cabinet standing against the wall" src="/blog/arcade-machine-build/20-first-assembly.jpg"/>
    <img loading="lazy" alt="Top board on top of both lateral boards" src="/blog/arcade-machine-build/21-first-assembly-top-detail.jpg"/>

    <p>I attached the front and back panels with 3.5 mm x 40 mm screws.</p>

    <img loading="lazy" alt="Controllers board on top of both lateral boards" src="/blog/arcade-machine-build/22-first-assembly-middle-detail.jpg"/>

    <p><strong>I've also installed the bottom cover and attached two wheels to move the cabinet around.</strong> I made a diagonal cut in both laterals to let the wheels lean on the floor when the cabinet is inclined.</p>

    <img loading="lazy" alt="A wheel installed on the bottom back of the cabinet" src="/blog/arcade-machine-build/23-wheel.jpg"/>
    <img loading="lazy" alt="Both wheels installed on the bottom of the cabinet" src="/blog/arcade-machine-build/24-both-wheels.jpg"/>

    <h2 id="monitor">Monitor</h2>

    <p>I had an old 26" Samsung monitor that was perfect for this cabinet. I believe that a 26-inch screen is too large for playing retro games when standing so close to it. <strong>An ideal size would be around 22" to 24", but I wouldn't spend money on a new monitor when I had this one at home.</strong></p>

    <p>The problem was that this monitor has no VESA holes in the back to attach it to a wall mount. But, I found an unofficial mount that replaces the original base. <strong>I installed the mount onto a board, adding a small "T" for extra support to prevent bending under the weight of the monitor.</strong></p>

    <!-- <img loading="lazy" alt="Mount" src="/blog/arcade-machine-build/25-mount.jpg"> -->
    <img loading="lazy" alt="A board with a little strip glued behind, forming a T" src="/blog/arcade-machine-build/26-T-support.jpg"/>

    <p>I made a placeholder in paper to be able <strong>to see more clearly where the screen needed to be mounted</strong>.</p>

    <img loading="lazy" alt="A sketch of a monitor made out of paper, installed on the wooden cabinet" src="/blog/arcade-machine-build/27-paper-monitor.jpg"/>

    <img loading="lazy" alt="The metal connector that holds the monitor, installed on the wooden cabinet. The monitor is missing." src="/blog/arcade-machine-build/29-installed-mount.jpg"/>

    <p>Using some leftovers of the strips, <strong>I added 2 supports on the back and 2 triangles to hold the acrylic cover</strong>.</p>
    
    <img loading="lazy" alt="2 wooden strips to the sides of the metal connector" src="/blog/arcade-machine-build/30-monitor-supports.jpg"/>

    <img loading="lazy" alt="The wooden cabinet empty. It has 4 strips that allow the monitor to be held in place" src="/blog/arcade-machine-build/32-monitor-area-supports.jpg"/>

    <h2 id="controllers">Controllers</h2>

    <p>There are lots of different game controllers available for DIY projects out there. <strong>I bought a "MAME kit" which included</strong>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>2 Sanwa-like joysticks.</li>
      <li>16 HAPP push buttons: 7 in red, 7 in blue, and 2 in white that I attached to the sides to play pinball games.</li>
      <li>1P/2P buttons.</li>
      <li>USB board with cables for every button.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I did a little research about button positions in arcade cabinets. I found <a href="https://www.slagcoin.com/joystick/layout.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this article</a> about the most common layouts. The author of the post has also made their own distribution based on an average of several controllers.</p>

    <img loading="lazy" alt="A diagram of 8 rounded buttons and one joystick" src="/blog/arcade-machine-build/68-joystick-layout.png"/>

    <p>In my case <strong>I went for a mix between a couple of Sega layouts. I tested it on a cardboard box to be sure it looked good.</strong></p>

    <img loading="lazy" alt="6 plastic red buttons and a joystick with a red ball, mounted on a cardboard box" src="/blog/arcade-machine-build/33-controllers-in-cardboard.jpg"/>

    <p>I drew the holes for all the components on the MDF board and drilled all the 18 holes.</p>

    <img loading="lazy" alt="A wooden board with 18 circles where the buttons are going to be" src="/blog/arcade-machine-build/34-controllers-draw.jpg"/>
    <img loading="lazy" alt="A closeup of holes in the wood" src="/blog/arcade-machine-build/35-controllers-holes-detail.jpg"/>

    <img loading="lazy" alt="All 18 holes in a wooden panel" src="/blog/arcade-machine-build/36-controllers-holes.jpg"/>

    <p>I installed the MAME kit, including joysticks, 14 push buttons, 1P/2P buttons, and the USB board.</p>

    <img loading="lazy" alt="All 18 buttons installed. The all the wires that connect them can be seen. There is a board in the middle where all the cables go to." src="/blog/arcade-machine-build/37-installing-controllers.jpg"/>
    <img loading="lazy" alt="All 18 buttons installed. Half of them are red, the other half are blue" src="/blog/arcade-machine-build/38-controllers-installed.jpg"/>

    <h2 id="speakers">Speakers</h2>

    <p>I had a Genius 2.1-channels speaker with subwoofer that I got back in 2007 with my first job. It has a wooden cabinet and an exceptional deep bass. The cardboard model was handy to make the first check on the size and place of the speakers. <strong>Now with the arcade cabinet right in front of me, I could double-check the ideal spots for the holes and grills.</strong></p>

    <img loading="lazy" alt="Arcade cabinet with 2 rounded holes for small speakers on the top board" src="/blog/arcade-machine-build/40-speaker-holes.jpg"/>

    <img loading="lazy" alt="2 rounded papers on the front bottom of the cabinet, where the speakers holes will be" src="/blog/arcade-machine-build/41-bottom-stencils.jpg"/>

    <p>Even though the speakers come with only one subwoofer, <strong>I decided to make 2 holes to the cabinet. I ended up using the second one to hold a 140 mm fan.</strong></p>

    <img loading="lazy" alt="A PC fan attached to one of the big holes" src="/blog/arcade-machine-build/42-attached-cooler.jpg"/>

    <img loading="lazy" alt="The arcade cabinet, with everything installed. A game can be seen on the monitor." src="/blog/arcade-machine-build/43-speakers-installed.jpg"/>

    <!-- <p>I found generic speakers grilles on <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AliExpress.com</a>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>(2) 9cm black mesh (12cm including frame)</li>
      <li>(2) 15cm black mesh (18cm including frame)</li>
    </ul> -->

    <h2 id="acrylics">Acrylics</h2>

    <!-- <h3 id="monitor-cover">Monitor cover</h3> -->
    <p>I bought some crystal-clear <strong>acrylic boards to cover the monitor, controllers, and marquee</strong>. After sanding some edges of the biggest acrylic board, I attached it to the triangle strips and put some screws in the back of the speakers board.</p>

    <img loading="lazy" alt="An acrylic attached to the front of the cabinet with screws" src="/blog/arcade-machine-build/44-triangle-battens-attach.jpg"/>
    <img loading="lazy" alt="An acrylic attached to the back of the cabinet with screws" src="/blog/arcade-machine-build/45-speakers-board-attach.jpg"/>

    <!-- <h3 id="marquee">Marquee</h3> -->
    
    <p>For the marquee, I used <strong>2 sheets of acrylic to hold a semi-transparent print in between</strong>. I attached both sheets with 4 stainless steel clamps.</p>

    <img loading="lazy" alt="The marquee on the top of the cabinet, with its light on" src="/blog/arcade-machine-build/46-marquee.jpg"/>

    <!-- <h3 id="controllers-cover">Controllers cover</h3> -->

    <p><strong>I had to drill 18 holes in an acrylic sheet to install the buttons.</strong> I'm glad I decided to get one extra sheet to do some tests because the first experience of drilling acrylic was terrible. <strong>The acrylic melted down over the heat of the drill bit.</strong></p>

    <img loading="lazy" alt="4 holes on an acrylic sheet. The acrylic is melted." src="/blog/arcade-machine-build/47-melted-holes.jpg"/>

    <p>Then I realized that using water keeps the drill bit and the acrylic cold.</p>

    <img loading="lazy" alt="Drilling holes in the acrylic using water" src="/blog/arcade-machine-build/48-drilling-with-water.jpg"/>

    <p>It took around 10 minutes to make each hole. I finished the job with a lot of patience.</p>

    <h2 id="painting">Painting</h2>

    <!-- <img loading="lazy" alt="Paint kit" src="/blog/arcade-machine-build/50-paint-kit.jpg"> -->
    <!-- <h3 id="wood-putty">Wood putty</h3> -->

    <p><strong>I covered all the screws with wood putty and sanded everything until I got a smooth surface.</strong></p>

    <img loading="lazy" alt="The arcade cabinet with all the screws covered in putty" src="/blog/arcade-machine-build/51-putty.jpg"/>
    
    <!-- <h3 id="primer">Primer</h3> -->
    
    <p><strong>I applied white primer paint for MDF to the entire cabinet.</strong> I made sure the first coat was applied with a more liquid consistency than necessary. That way the wood absorves the paint more easily. <strong>The primer paint seals the pores of the wood and sets a base color to apply other painting coats.</strong></p>

    <img loading="lazy" alt="The lateral of the cabinet, half wooden color, half white" src="/blog/arcade-machine-build/52-first-paint.jpg"/>
    <img loading="lazy" alt="The arcade cabinet all white" src="/blog/arcade-machine-build/53-base-paint.jpg"/>

    <p>I masked everything except both laterals, using blue paper tape.</p>

    <p>Then, <strong>I applied glossy white spraypaint to the sides and to the controllers board</strong>. Having a white surface helps making the colors of the printed art pop out.</p>

    <p>I applied matte black spraypaint to the rest of the cabinet.</p>

    <p>This is how the arcade cabinet looked like before applying the vinyls:</p>

    <p>The author of the Paper Mario cabinet <strong>made the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220701142854/https://zonaarcade.forumcommunity.net/?t=45015457" target="_blank" rel="noopener">side art</a> available</strong>. So, I printed it in vinyl and installed it on all the white boards.</p>

    <h2 id="finale">Results</h2>

    <p>The cherry on the cake were the <strong>white buttons I added on both sides of the cabinet</strong>. That way <strong>I'm able to play pinball games</strong>. I connected those buttons directly to other existing buttons (left d-pad and "A") because that's what every retro pinball game uses.</p>
