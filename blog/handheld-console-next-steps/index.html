    <p>The <a href="https://youtu.be/gkook0l_gsM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video of the DIY handheld game console</a> reached <strong>1 million views on YouTube</strong>!</p>
    
    <p>It's kinda funny because <strong>this project basically started as a prototype</strong>, just to see how far I was able to go. But then, I got a bunch of constructive feedback in the comments, and that got me hyped to <strong>dive into the next round of improvements</strong>.</p>
    
    <p>So in this post, I'm going to share with you:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>What's new.</li>
      <li>What I'm working on.</li>
      <li>What comes next.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Here's the video if you wanna watch it again:</p>

    <lite-youtube videoid="gkook0l_gsM"></lite-youtube>

    <h2>1. What's new</h2>

    <p>I've put together a <a href="/blog/diy-handheld-game-console/">step-by-step guide</a> so anyone can build this console at home. It includes all the decisions I made and the options I left out of the table.</p>
    
    <p><a href="/blog/diy-handheld-game-console/"><img class="pixelated" style="display:inline;margin:0 5px 0 0;vertical-align:middle" src="/blog/diy-handheld-game-console/handheld-icon.gif" itemprop="image" alt="An icon representing a D-pad of a gamepad"  width="28" height="32"> How to build a handheld game console</a></p>
    
    <!-- <p>There are tons of guides out there on how to build DIY consoles, but for this one I ended up using lots of different documentations to build exactly what I wanted. So this guide (and the project itself) is a compilation of multiple different sources.</p> -->

    <p>Check out the <a href="/blog/diy-handheld-game-console#philosophy">Philosophy section</a> of the guide to see how you don't need to drop all your money on components at once. You can start enjoying the console from day one with stuff you might already have.</p>


    <h2>2. What I'm working on</h2>

    <p>A number of people reached out to ask for the printable files. Please understand <strong>this is a prototype. Therefore, there are important flaws in the design.</strong></p>
    
    <p>I know it sounds trivial, but <strong>every change I make has a snowball effect</strong>. If I move a button 0.1cm, there is probably not enough space for the battery. Then when I move the battery, the outer shape needs to change. If the shape of the console changes, some buttons need to move a couple of millimeters.</p>
    
    <p>I think you get the idea.</p>

    
    <h3>Issue 1. Joints</h3>

    <!-- <p>Since the constraints in 3D printing are different than the ones found on injection molding, <strong>there are different structural posibilities when building physical products.</strong></p> -->
    
    <!-- <p>For this console, instead of cutting the piece horizontally in the middle and using a dozen screws to held them together, <strong>I made 2 parallel cuts to have 3 pieces that join using only 2 screws in total</strong>:</p> -->

    <!-- <img src="/blog/handheld-console-next-steps/3-printed-pieces.jpg" alt=""/> -->

    <p>To get all the case pieces to line up properly, I've been using these little holes that connect with the other pieces using a short bit of filament. <strong>This is structuraly weak and can't stand all the forces and movements one does with the hands.</strong></p>

    <img src="/blog/handheld-console-next-steps/guides.jpg" alt="Guides used to align the pieces."/>

    <p>The solution I'm working on is <strong>making a lip around the entire circumference of the enclosure</strong>. The problem is that there is little space for that. So <strong>I'm moving some other things around to make space</strong>.</p>


    <h3>Issue 2. Shoulder buttons</h3>

    <p>The shoulder buttons work by having <strong>90-degree pieces of plastic integrated into the main structure</strong> where the push buttons are located:</p>

    <img src="/blog/handheld-console-next-steps/shoulder-buttons-current.jpg" alt=""/>

    <p><strong>This is a terrible way</strong> of having tactile buttons at 90 degrees. I'm currently redesigning those pieces to <strong>use proper 90-degrees push-buttons</strong>, so in the future <strong>this can be a custom PCB</strong>.</p>

    <img src="/blog/handheld-console-next-steps/90-degrees-push-buttons.jpg" alt="90 degrees tactile push buttons."/>


    <h3>Issue 3. ABXY buttons</h3>

    <p>I realized too late that the A and B buttons follow the Nintendo layout, whereas the X and Y buttons use the PC/Xbox layout. <strong>I've already switched to the latter:</strong></p>

    <img src="/blog/handheld-console-next-steps/ABXY-pc-layout.jpg" alt="ABXY buttons with the PC layout."/>

    <p>My main priority right now is to <strong>fix those issues to make the case available to everyone</strong>. Then I'll focus on the next iteration of the console with <strong>analog thumbsticks, xbox controller buttons, a custom PCB and a good paint job</strong>.</p>


    <h2>3. What comes next</h2>

    
    <h3>Thumbsticks</h3>

    <!-- <p>This console is (allegedly) capable of running the latest generation titles via Xbox Cloud Gaming. The work on this is already in progress, and it look promising.</p> -->

    <p>Since this console is able to run not-so-old games (and maybe latest-gen games via Xbox Cloud Gaming as well) <strong>I'm adding 2 analog thumbsticks</strong>. The problem with the Raspberry Pi is that <strong>it lacks of analog inputs, so I'm adding an Arduino Pro Micro in-between</strong>.</p>

    <img src="/blog/handheld-console-next-steps/thumbsticks-arduino.jpg" alt="Analog sticks connected to an Arduino Pro Micro, connected to the handheld game console."/>

    <p>To make the installation easier I'll <strong>move all the digital buttons from the GPIO pins to the Arduino</strong> as well.</p>

    <p>Adding thumbsticks is not trivial, though. I need to reposition the d-pad, Select and Start buttons. The enclosure will more likely end up wider because of that. <strong>I'll share all the details in a new video. Stay tuned!</strong></p>


    <h3>Official buttons</h3>

    <p>I'll adapt the shape of all the buttons to be able to also <strong>accomodate the official Xbox controller buttons</strong>. The idea is to keep the 3D-printable buttons as an option so you're not forced to salvage your controller.</p>


    <h3>Also</h3>

    <p>I'm looking for a name since I can't keep calling it "the handheld game console", so I'm up to hear your ideas.</p>

    <p>Btw, do you want me to e-mail you when I have news about the console? Drop your address here:</p>

    <form class="lemme-know" method="post" action="https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbxW332fsZdmjH0TsUDYXkLr-esSLQAKMYdsqLKbGbLp66tJo_gAvJsQbA4AkJ4MrsWJ/exec">
      <input type="email" name="email" required placeholder="Your e-mail address"/>
      <input type="hidden" name="src" value="/blog/handheld-console-next-steps"/>
      <button type="submit">Send</button>
    </form>

    <p>That's it for now! Thank you for the patience and keep the good feedback coming.</p>
