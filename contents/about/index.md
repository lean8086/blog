Hi there, my name is Leandro Linares and I'm a front-end developer and a maker from Buenos Aires, Argentina. I'm currently working at [MercadoLibre.com](https://www.mercadolibre.com/), part of the Nasdaq 100 index and one of the largest online commerce and payments platform in Latin America.

My main focus is to help people with creative problem-solving. I'm always searching ways to use what I learn to make easier the job of the developers I work with, so they can focus on real issues.

I'm currently part of the small team that's moving forward the tech stack of the front-end of Mercado Libre. The efforts also includes to coach the people behind every new implementation. I'm working with: Node, React, Redux, Sass, Webpack, and plain JS (because never goes out of style üëç).

Back in 2015 I‚Äôve applied the concept of Single Page App on certain sections of Mercado Libre. That have made possible to position a team of formerly Web designers as JavaScript developers. I‚Äôve worked with Backbone, Marionette, Handlebars, Less and Gulp.

From 2009 to 2013 I've been part of the team that unified the common UI components of Mercado Libre in a library called [Chico UI](http://chico.mercadolibre.com/). A jQuery-based collection of customizable components.
