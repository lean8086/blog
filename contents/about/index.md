![Me](../assets/avatar@2x.png)

I am **Leandro Linares**, Front-End and JavaScript developer. I have worked for the last 10 years in the internet industry at [MercadoLibre.com](https://www.mercadolivre.com.br/). It is one of the largest e-commerces and fintech platforms in Latin America.

I started designing user-centered interfaces, focused in UX research and experimentation. I gradually turned to front-end programming and involved myself more with the ins and outs of the Web.

I am currently focused on Payments, working on building a new version of the checkout at [MercadoPago.com](https://www.mercadopago.com.br/) by implementing cutting-edge technologies.
