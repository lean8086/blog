Hello there, my name is Leandro Linares and I'm a front-end developer from Buenos Aires, Argentina. I'm currently working at [MercadoLibre.com](https://www.mercadolibre.com/), part of the Nasdaq 100 index and one of the largest online commerce and fintech platform in Latin America.

Last year, I was part of the small team that updated the entire front-end stack of the company. The efforts also includes to coach the people behind every new implementation. I'm working with: Node, React, Redux, Sass, Webpack, and plain JS (because never goes out of style üëç).

Back in 2015 I‚Äôve applied the concept of Single Page App on certain sections of Mercado Libre. I‚Äôve worked with Backbone, Marionette, Handlebars, Less and Gulp.

From 2009 to 2013 I've been part of the team that unified the common UI components of Mercado Libre in a library called [Chico UI](http://chico.mercadolibre.com/). A jQuery-based collection of customizable components.
