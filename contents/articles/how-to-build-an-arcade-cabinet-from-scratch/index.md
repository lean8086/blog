title: How I built my arcade machine from scratch

Some time ago, I won a starter kit from [Make Magazine](https://makezine.com/) with a Raspberry Pi Model 1.

![Raspberry Pi kit](#)

Since then, I started looking for something interesting to build and I found the [RetroPie Project](https://retropie.org.uk/).


## RetroPie

RetroPie allows you to turn your Raspberry Pi into a retro-gaming machine. So I made a quick test with some ROMs to check how it worked. It was really easy to have a working retro console with nearly zero configuration.

It took me many [attempts to setup](https://lean8086.com/articles/a-complete-guide-to-setting-up-retropie/) and make the most of it, but everything was worth it in the end.


## The must haves

I started looking everywhere for an old arcade cabinet to make a restoration and adaptation, but I only found extremely expensive wooden cabinets in very bad conditions.

Most of them were:

- Expensive.
- Not worthwhile for restore.
- Hard to move.
- Too big for an apartment.

![Ugly arcade cabinet, number 2](#)
![Ugly arcade cabinet, number 3](#)

By making that research I realized that the only way to get the results I wanted would be by building my own arcade cabinet from scratch.

In that terms, I was looking for something that was:

- Relatively easy to build.
- Affordable.
- Sized for an apartment.
- Old-school/nostalgic.
- Able to use some old hardware that I already had.


## The plans

Right after found some caracteristics of what would be my ideal arcade machine, I also found the [Project MAME](http://koenigs.dk/mame/eng/index.htm).

It's a project that provides open source plans to build an arcade cabinet from scratch, detailed [step-by-step](http://koenigs.dk/mame/eng/stepprojectmame.htm).

![Original cabinet from Project MAME](#)

Although It was made to handle an X-arcade controller, it also was a good adaptation from old-school cabinets that was made to perfectly fit a flat screen inside.

One of the builds that emerged from Project MAME and caught my attention was this [Paper Mario themed arcade](http://zonaarcade.forumcommunity.net/?t=48865036).

This spanish maker not only [improved the original plans](http://img543.imageshack.us/img543/5624/repordiviciacosplanos.gif), but also he made available the [side art](https://zonaarcade.forumcommunity.net/?t=45015457) and a 3D model in [SketchUp](https://www.sketchup.com/).

![3D model of arcade cabinet](#)

I *only* had to modify the width of the plans by 2cm so the cabinet could fit a Samsung 26" LCD screen that I've already had. The rest was followed as specified.


## Model in cardboard

The first approach to test the dimensions and distribution of the elements was making a 1:10 model in cardboard as Project MAME suggests in the [step-by-step guide](http://koenigs.dk/mame/eng/stepprojectmame.htm).

That way I was sure that all made sense and I was able to check if something needed to be adjusted or redefined. Especially after the width modification that I had to do to fit my monitor.

![Model in cardboard](#)

The model is 17cm height and it helped me to define the size and distribution of the speakers too.


## The materials

Before to spend some money on materials, there was a very important decision to make about what kind of wood I would use: *MDF/HDF, plywood or particleboard*.

I *wrongly* chose MDF/HDF. If I would know at that time how hard is to clean up the extremely thin powder after sand, I wouldn't chose that one. But in the other hand it was a very versatile wood: easy to cut, drill and give shape by sanding.

![MDF pieces](#)

MDF/HDF boards [todo]:

- *(2) 176cm x 60cm*: Both sides
- *cm x 62cm*: Front panel
- *cm x 62cm*: Back panel
- *cm x 62cm x 5mm thin*: Back door
- *22cm x 62cm*: Controllers top panel
- *15cm x 62cm*: Controllers front panel
- *cm x 62cm*: Speakers panel
- *cm x 62cm*: Marquee top panel
- *cm x 62cm*: Marquee bottom panel
- *cm x 62cm*: Monitor support

Acrylic boards [todo]:

- *cm x 62cm*: Monitor cover
- *25cm x 62cm*: Controllers art cover
- *(2) 13cm x 62cm*: Marquee back and front

Other items that I bought [todo]:

- [4cm x 2cm pine battens](#battens)
- [Caladora de mano Black+Decker](#cuts)
- [3cm mechas](#)
- [10 lijas de X (gruesa) y de Y (fina)](#lijing)
- [tornillos para madera, tornillos para battengs](#)
- [Sanwa? controllers 12 buttons + 2 white buttons](#controllers)
- [Crystal-clear acrylic boards](#acrylics)
- [Speaker grills](#acrylics)
- [Wheels](#acrylics)
- [4xmatte black + 2x white spray paint + base paint](#painting)


## Cutting [todo]

After getting all the materials, I started drawing on the lateral boards all the shapes using the measurements from the plans. I also used a compass to draw the curves.

![Drawings on the board](#)

I sticked both boards togheter with tape to make only one cut. Using a caladora started from bottom to top. I always recommend to move forward very slowly to stick to the line as much as possible.

![Cutted boards](#)

By making my first cut, I learnt some things:

- **MDF/HDF detaches an extremely thin powder:** It doesn't matter how much protection you can wear (gloves, barbijo, gafas), I had powder in my mouth, hair and clothes for days. It was nearly impossible to clean up after cut or sand. Even I broke a hand aspirator.
- **The hot sierra burns the wood:** Don't try to make a cut in a single run. It's better to let the sierra rest from time to time.
- **While making the cut, the saw is probably going to curve:** It would have been better to cut both boards separatelly, because the thicker is what we are cutting the more the sierra curves. That way both boards were uneven and I had to correct by sanding.

## Sanding [todo]

I used XXXXX white (why white):

![White sandpaper](#)

After sanding all the bordes I got a good shape. Tambien aproveche para emparejar errores del corte.

![Both boards sanded](#)

## Battens

I decided to join the pieces with battens, glued and fixed with screws. **That way I had millimetric precision and I didn't needed assistance.**

I bought a lot of 4cm x 2cm (1.6in x 0.8in) pine battens and cutted in pieces smaller than the pieces they join.

![Four by two battens](#)

It's not necessary to use glue when you're already using screws, but I decided to use it anyway to hold tight the entire structure.

![Glued and screwed battens](#)

I've also ensanché los agujeros para darle un mejor acabado a los tornillos y que no sobresalgan.

![Holes in battens](#)

I attached *all* the battens to the lateral boards.

![Attached battens](#)


## First armado [todo]

...to see the final form and size. My first impression was to see a huge fridge inside my apartment. But with the time and adding some color is not that bad.

![First armado](#)

I also attached wheels and make some diagonal cuts...

![Both wheels installed](#)


### Monitor

I decided to use some old hardware that I already had at home.

I had a good old LCD monitor (Samsung T260n, 26") that was perfect for this cabinet. I think an ideal size would be about 23", but I wouldn't spend money in a new monitor when I had that one.

There was one constraint: this monitor was originally made to be beautiful from behind, so it has no holes in the back to fix to a support with screws.

![The back part of the monitor](#)

Busque y por suerte encontre un soporte (no oficial ni estandar) para ese monitor. es un reemplazo del pie, que genera el agarre de un soporte comun y corriente que monte sobre una T.

![The mounted support](#)

I made the calculations...

## Controllers

busque sobre controles y encontre info re completa de las disposiciones mas usadas.. en la misma pagina hace mencion a que el pibe hizo un promedio de todas e hizo la suya.. use esa.

I bought XXXXX

prueba disposicion con carton aspiradora

![Cardboard holes for controllers](#)
![Controllers mounted in cardboard](#)

make some tries in the actual cabinet:

then i drew in the wood

mecha fue un quilombo conseguir, porque los botones tenian que entrar.. necesitaba una de 28mm consegui de 30mm

aguheros maderas



### acrilico

primero se rompio todo, se derretia, traccionaba la mecha

el secreto es cortar con agua.. lleva unos 10 minutos por agujero, pero queda como corte de bistri:
