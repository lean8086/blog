  "description": "Remember remember... I almost forgot to submit the challenge for this week of #spriteweekly. This time I worked on a minimalist mask of Guy Hawkes. I found some struggling working on 16x16 due to the limited space and colors, and for those reasons I really enjoyed to find the best way to represent an icon and to acomplish this week challenge.",
